It also aims to give users the oppertunity write their own extensions on program level.

The Obsidian.py file is version 1. it uses hardcoded path's for the files destinations and can't go deeper than the main directory you sellected.
it creates a webpage with the graph of you vault.

The Obsidian v2.py file is version 2. it creates a simple GUI for users to select their directory and is able to find files in sub-directories.
it creates a webpage with the graph of you vault.

The Obsidian v3.py file is version 3 and is still in development. the goal is to have the graph be rendered in the GUI itself and not in a webpage.
