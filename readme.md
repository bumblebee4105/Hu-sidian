This project is inspired by Obsidian Notes and aims to create an open source version that is feature competative with the original.
It also aims to give users the oppertunity write their own extensions on program level.

The Obsidian.py file is version 1. it uses hardcoded path's for the files destinations and can't go deeper than the main directory you sellected.
it creates a webpage with the graph of you vault.

The Obsidian v2.py file is version 2. it creates a simple GUI for users to select their directory and is able to find files in sub-directories.
it creates a webpage with the graph of you vault.

The Obsidian v3.py file is version 3 and is the first to have a local gui instead of a web rendered one.

The Obsidian v4.py file is version 4 and has a locally generated gui. 
users can zoom in and out, move trough the graph and change graph forces like how users can do in the real Obsidian.
V4 also adds a relyable way to search files based on their tags and users can now hover over nodes and they and their connections get highlighted.

Hu-sidian v1.py is the first of its family to have the Obsidian Notes force graph integrated in beta.

Hu-sidian v2.py builds further on Hu-sidian v1 by fully implementing the force graph and creating different lengths for links between different kinds of nodes.
